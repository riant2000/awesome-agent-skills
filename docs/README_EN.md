This project is dedicated to collecting and sharing the finest Skills tutorials, case studies, and best practices, helping more people easily take their first step in building Agents.

> Follow me on 𝕏 [@libukai](https://x.com/libukai) for the latest news and practical tutorials about Agent Skills!

## Quick Start

Agent Skills is an [open standard](https://agentskills.io/home) maintained by Anthropic, designed to teach AI how to handle specific tasks and workflows.

It is one of the most powerful ways to customize AI for your specific needs. When you need to execute repeatable workflows, you no longer need to explain your preferences, processes, and domain knowledge in every conversation with AI. Skills let you teach the AI once and benefit every time.

Skills work seamlessly with AI's built-in capabilities (such as code execution and document creation). For users building and using MCP, it also provides another powerful layer of functionality — helping AI transform external tool access into reliable, optimized workflows.

This standard has been adopted by leading AI companies including Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Cursor, quickly becoming standard in mainstream AI tools.

According to the standard, each Skill is a standardized named folder that combines Markdown documents, executable scripts, and other material files.

## Skills Marketplace

[![](../assets/media/skills_sh.png)](https://skills.sh/)

It is recommended to use Vercel's [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) leaderboard, which provides an intuitive view of the most popular Skills repositories and individual Skill usage.

[![skillsmp](../assets/media/skills_smp.png)](https://skillsmp.com/zh)

Additionally, you can use the [skillsmp](https://skillsmp.com/zh) marketplace, which automatically indexes all Skills projects on GitHub and organizes them by category, update time, star count, and other tags.

Other featured Agent Skills marketplaces:

-   [context7](https://context7.com/?tab=skills): Skill marketplace based on Context7
-   [skillstore.io](https://skillstore.io/zh-hans): Chinese marketplace with security-audited Skills
-   [agentskills.me](https://agentskills.me/): Marketplace offering cloud-based Skill runtime environments
-   [skills.rest](https://skills.rest/): Marketplace providing Skill analysis and security reviews

## Product Usage

Agent Skills is a cross-platform standard based on the file system, allowing flexible integration into various products.

An increasing number of programming tools and conversational tools are now supporting the Agent Skills standard, with more usage scenarios expected to emerge.

### Programming Tools

To install Agent Skills in programming tools, simply place the Skill folder in the appropriate path.

It is recommended to use Vercel's official `npx skills find <query>` / `npx skills add <owner/repo>` CLI tool for quick discovery and installation. For parameters, see [npmjs/skills](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills).
