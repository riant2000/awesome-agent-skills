## Basic Introduction

Skill is a lightweight universal open standard that extends AI's specific capabilities by packaging professional knowledge and workflows.

When you need to execute repeatable tasks, you no longer need to repeatedly provide your processes, knowledge, and preferences in every conversation with AI. Simply convert the relevant content into a Skill, and AI can learn the related skills on its own.

After half a year of development and iteration, the Skill standard has been widely supported by various AI products and has become the standard solution for enhancing personalized AI capabilities in Claude Code-like ecosystems and OpenClaw-like ecosystems.

## Standard Structure

According to the standard definition, each Skill is a standardized named folder that combines instructions, scripts, and resources. AI progressively imports these contents in context to understand and learn related skills.

```markdown
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: description and metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation references
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

## Quick Installation

### Claude Code Ecosystem

![](../assets/media/skills_mp.png)

It is recommended to use the [skillsmp](https://skillsmp.com/zh) marketplace, which automatically indexes all Skills projects on GitHub and organizes them by category, update time, star count, and other tags.

You can also use Vercel's [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) leaderboard to intuitively view the most popular Skills repositories and individual Skill usage.

For specific skills, use the `npx skills` command-line tool to quickly discover, add, and manage skills. For detailed parameters, see [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

```bash
npx skills find [query] # Search for related skills
npx skills add <owner/repo> # Add skills from specified git or local path
npx skills list # List installed skills
npx skills update # Upgrade skills
npx skills remove [skill-name] # Uninstall skills
```

### OpenClaw Ecosystem

![](../assets/media/clawhub.png)

If you have access to international networks and use the official OpenClaw version, it is recommended to use the official [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com/) marketplace, which provides more technical-oriented skills and includes integration with many overseas products.

```bash
npx clawhub search "postgres backups"  # Search for related skills
npx clawhub install <skill-name> # Install skill by name
npx clawhub update --all # Upgrade skills
npx clawhub update --all --no-input --force # Force upgrade skills
```

![](../assets/media/skillshub.png)

For users primarily in Chinese network environments or using customized versions of OpenClaw in China, it is recommended to use Tencent's [SkillHub](https://skillhub.tencent.com/) marketplace, which provides many skills more suitable for Chinese users' needs.

First, you need to install the Skill Hub CLI tool, which can be installed with the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://skillhub-1251783334.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/install/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, you can use the following commands to install and manage skills:

```bash
skillhub search [query] # Search for related skills
skillhub install <skill-name> # Add skills using skill name
skillhub list # List installed skills
skillhub upgrade # Upgrade installed skills
```

## Skill Creation

Although you can directly install and use skills created by others through skill marketplaces, it is recommended to create your own skills or fine-tune others' skills based on your needs to improve adaptability and personalization.

Here are some quality skill creation resources to help you quickly get started with skill creation.
